# Customer-Credit-Scores

# 1.0 Background

According to https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/average-credit-score?r=US&IR=T, the average credit score in the US is a 714, based on FICO data provided by credit reporting company Experian. Credit scores, which are like a grade for your borrowing history, fall in the range of 300 to 850. The higher your score, the better, the report further states.

FICO is the acronym for Fair Isaac Corporation, as well as the name for the credit scoring model that Fair Isaac Corporation developed. A FICO credit score is a tool used by many lenders to determine if a person qualifies for a credit card, mortgage, or other loan.

Investopedia (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.aspA) states that credit score is based on your credit history, which includes information like the number accounts, total levels of debt, repayment history, and other factors. Lenders use credit scores to evaluate your credit worthiness, or the likelihood that you will repay loans in a timely manner.
